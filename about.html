<p>Cornell University is a private Ivy League statutory land-grant research university based in Ithaca, New York. The university was founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White with the intention of teaching and making contributions in all fields of knowledge from the classics to <img src=images/9.jpeg class=img4>the sciences and from the theoretical to the applied.

The university is organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus with each college and division defining its specific admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers three satellite campuses, including two in New York City and one in the Education City region of Qatar.

Cornell is one of the few private land grant universities in the United States.[a] Of its seven undergraduate colleges, three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York (SUNY) system, including its agricultural and human ecology colleges and its industrial labor relations school. Among Cornell's graduate schools, only the veterinary college is state-supported. As a land grant college, Cornell operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York state and receives annual funding from the State of New York for various educational missions.[10] The main campus of Cornell University in Ithaca spans 745 acres (more than 4,300 acres when the Cornell Botanic Gardens and the numerous university-owned lands in New York City are included).The main campus is marked by an irregular layout and eclectic architectural styles, including ornate Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and Neoclassical buildings, and the more spare international, and modernist structures. The more ornate buildings generally predate World War II. The student population doubled from 7,000 in 1950 to 15,000 by 1970, at a time when architectural styles favored modernism.[45] While some buildings are neatly arranged into quadrangles, others are packed densely and haphazardly. These eccentricities arose from the university's numerous, ever-changing master plans for the campus.

<p>Cornell University was founded on April 27, 1865 by Ezra Cornell, an entrepreneur and New York State Senator, and Andrew Dickson White, an educator and fellow New York State Senator, after the New York State legislature authorized the university<img src=images/11.jpg class=img5> as the state's land grant institution.[18] Ezra Cornell offered his farm in Ithaca, New York as a preliminary site for the university along with $500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial endowment, and White agreed to be Cornell University's first president.

During Cornell University's first three years, White oversaw the construction of the first two buildings and traveled to attract students and faculty.[19] The university was inaugurated on October 7, 1868, and 412 men were enrolled the next day.[20]

Cornell developed as a technologically innovative institution, applying its research to its own campus and to outreach efforts. In 1883, it was one of the first university campuses to use electricity from a water-powered dynamo to light the campus grounds.[21] Since 1894, Cornell has included colleges that are state funded and fulfill statutory requirements;[22] it has also administered research and extension activities that have been jointly funded by New York state along with federal government matching programs.The main campus is marked by an irregular layout and eclectic architectural styles, including ornate Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and Neoclassical buildings, and the more spare international, and modernist structures.

<p>Cornell's main campus is on East Hill in Ithaca, New York, and overlooks the city and Cayuga Lake. Since the university's founding, it has expanded to about 2,300 acres (930 ha) encompassing both the hill and much of the surrounding areas.[38] Central Campus has laboratories, administrative buildings, <img src=images/10.jpeg class=img4>and almost all of the campus' academic buildings, athletic facilities, auditoriums, and museums. North Campus is composed of ten residence halls[39] that primarily house first and second-year students, although the Townhouse Community occasionally houses transfer students. The five main residence halls on West Campus make up the West Campus House System, along with several Gothic-style buildings, referred to as "the Gothics".[40] Collegetown contains two upper-level residence halls[41][42] and the Schwartz Performing Arts Center, amid a mixed-use neighborhood of apartments, eateries, and businesses.[43] Construction has also been completed on three new residential buildings that will be situated on North Campus, providing beds for an estimated additional 1200 students, to be completed by fall 2022. These are named after Hu Shih, Barbara McClintock, and Ruth Bader Ginsburgâ€”all Cornell graduates.The university is organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus with each college and division defining its specific admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy.
