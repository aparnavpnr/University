<h2 style=font-size:30;>UNDERGRADUATE</h2>
<p style="margin:0 300 0 300;text-align:justify;">
The university offers various undergraduate courses which helps students to improve their skillset and capabilities.Undergraduate education is education conducted after secondary education and before postgraduate education. It typically includes all postsecondary programs up to the level of a bachelor's degree. For example, in the United States, an entry-level university student is known as an undergraduate, while students of higher degrees are known as graduate students. Upon completion of a number of required and elective courses as part of an undergraduate program, the student would earn the corresponding degree. (In some regions, individual "courses" and the "program" collection are given other terms, such as "units" and "course", respectively.) In some other educational systems, undergraduate education is postsecondary education up to and including the level of a master's degree; this is the case for some science courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe.

<h2 style=font-size:30;>POSTGRADUATE</h2>
<p style="margin:0 300 0 300;text-align:justify;">
The university offers various postgraduate courses which helps students to improve their skillset and capabilities.Postgraduate or graduate education refers to academic or professional degrees, certificates, diplomas, or other qualifications pursued by post-secondary students who have earned an undergraduate (bachelor's) degree.[1][2]

The organization and structure of postgraduate education varies in different countries, as well as in different institutions within countries. While the term "graduate school" or "grad school" is typically used in North America, "postgraduate" is often used in countries such as Australia, Bangladesh, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Graduate degrees can include master's degrees, doctoral degrees, and other qualifications such as graduate certificates and professional degrees. A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools, which can include medical school, law school, business school, and other institutions of specialized fields such as nursing, speechâ€“language pathology, engineering, or architecture. The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute since various professional schools offer graduate degrees and vice versa.

<h2 style=font-size:30;>RESEARCH</h2>
<p style="margin:0 300 0 300;text-align:justify;">
The university offers various research courses which helps students to improve their skillset and capabilities.Educational research refers to the systematic collection and analysis of data related to the field of education. Research may involve a variety of methods[1][2][3] and various aspects of education including student learning, interaction, teaching methods, teacher training, and classroom dynamics.[4]

Educational researchers generally agree that research should be rigorous and systematic.[2][4] However, there is less agreement about specific standards, criteria and research procedures.[1][5] As a result, the value and quality of educational research has been questioned. Educational researchers may draw upon a variety of disciplines including psychology, economics, sociology, anthropology, and philosophy.[1][3] Methods may be drawn from a range of disciplines.[3][5] Conclusions drawn from an individual research study may be limited by the characteristics of the participants who were studied and the conditions under which the study was conducted.
